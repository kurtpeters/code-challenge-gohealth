GoHealth JavaScript Exercise
============================


Welcome to the GoHealth JavaScript Exercise! Please read these instructions carefully. Email your GoHealth Technical Recruiter with any questions you have, and with a zip file of your solution once complete.


Requirements
------------

Extend JavaScript's native Number type with a toRoman() method that provides a Roman numeral representation of the value if it is between 0 and 3999. For example:

    > var currentYear = 2014;
    > currentYear.toRoman();
      "MMXIV"

There are two main components: the toRoman() code itself, and the supporting unit tests.

You can write the toRoman() code in src/roman.js, and a Jasmine-based test suite has been started for you in spec/romanSpec.js. Please extend the test suite until you are satisfied with the coverage it provides. The SpecRunner.html file will run your test suite.

Solutions will be evaluated on the following criteria, in order:

    1. Code design and construction
    2. Code readability and useful comments
    3. Correctly and completely implementing the specified functionality


Restrictions
------------

Use "vanilla" JavaScript only -- no other third-party plugins, libraries, or frameworks.


An Explanation of Roman Numerals
--------------------------------

[Courtesy of Wikipedia at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals. Please feel free to read further, but note that the "alternative forms" explained in the opening section are not in scope for this exercise and can be ignored.]

Roman numerals employs combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet to signify values:

    Symbol  Value
    I           1
    V           5
    X          10
    L          50
    C         100
    D         500
    M       1,000

Numbers are formed by combining symbols and adding the values. So II is two ones, i.e. 2, and XIII is a ten and three ones, i.e. 13. There is no zero in this system, so 207, for example, is CCVII, using the symbols for two hundreds, a five and two ones. 1066 is MLXVI, one thousand, fifty and ten, a five and a one.

Symbols are placed from left to right in order of value, starting with the largest. However, in a few specific cases, to avoid four characters being repeated in succession (such as IIII or XXXX) these can be reduced using subtractive notation as follows:

    - the numeral I can be placed before V and X to make 4 units (IV) and 9 units (IX respectively)
    - X can be placed before L and C to make 40 (XL) and 90 (XC respectively)
    - C can be placed before D and M to make 400 (CD) and 900 (CM) according to the same pattern

An example using the above rules would be 1904: this is composed of 1 (one thousand), 9 (nine hundreds), 0 (zero tens), and 4 (four units). To write the Roman numeral, each of the non-zero digits should be treated separately. Thus 1,000 = M, 900 = CM, and 4 = IV. Therefore, 1904 is MCMIV.
