GoHealth Coding Challenge
===========================

### Challenge: toRoman()

Extend JavaScript's native Number type with a toRoman() method that provides a Roman numeral representation of the value if it is between 0 and 3999. For example:

```
var currentYear = 2014;
currentYear.toRoman(); // will return "MMXIV"
```

There are two main components: the toRoman() code itself, and the supporting unit tests.

You can write the toRoman() code in src/roman.js, and a Jasmine-based test suite has been started for you in spec/romanSpec.js. Please extend the test suite until you are satisfied with the coverage it provides. The SpecRunner.html file will run your test suite.

Solutions will be evaluated on the following criteria, in order:

1. Code design and construction
2. Code readability and useful comments
3. Correctly and completely implementing the specified functionality


### Restrictions

Use "vanilla" JavaScript only -- no other third-party plugins, libraries, or frameworks.
